What's this? 
 
 - This is a simple web application that enables the user to view the contents of a table using JSP and Oracle Database. 


What does this program do? 

 - It has an input field which the user can type a specific table name and once selected, the whole contents of the table will be shown in the web page. Note that this simple application doesn't have a Pagination feature yet, so the tables with hundreds of thousands of rows (or even millions) will be shown in one page.
